    Our work builds upon the following foundations, while qualitatively differing from each.

    	\cparagraph{Entity alignment} Previous approaches of entity alignment typically
follow a labour-intensive and time-consuming process to tune model features. For example, the work presented in ~\cite{Wang2017} requires
one to collect network semantic labels like category labels, attribute labels and unstructured text keywords of the entity entries to build
the alignment model. Embedding-based methods~\cite{hao2016joint,chen2016multilingual,sun2017cross,zhu2017iterative} based on
TransE~\cite{bordes2013translating} have been proposed to address this feature engineering issue. However, these prior approaches have two
significant drawbacks. Firstly, they rely on seed alignment information which is difficult to obtain and construct. This limits their
practicability. Secondly, they ignore the attribute values which are crucial for entity alignment on heterogeneous \KGs. As a departure
from the previous embedding-based approaches, our work leverages \RGCNs to better characterize entities by incorporating the neighboring
relational structures and considers the specific attribute information, leading to significantly better alignment performance for
heterogeneous \KGs.

	\cparagraph{Graph convolutional networks} In recent years, \GCNs~\cite{Duvenaud2015Convolutional,Kearnes2016Molecular}
    have demonstrated promising results in domains that have previously been dominated by kernel-based methods or graph-based regularization.
    They are shown to be effective in performing NLP tasks like semi-supervised
    node classification~\cite{Kipf2016Semi}, semantic role labeling~\cite{Marcheggiani2017Encoding}, neural machine
    translation~\cite{Bastings2017Graph}. Our work extends the capability of \GCNs for processing relational data.


	\cparagraph{Relational graph convolutional networks}
	Recently, \RGCNs~\cite{Schlichtkrull2017Modeling} are proposed  for relational (directed and labeled) multi-graphs. It has been
successfully exploited in two standard NLP tasks: link prediction and entity classification~\cite{Schlichtkrull2017Modeling}. Our work is
the first to apply \RGCNs to entity alignment and the first to employ semantic and attribute embeddings as well as highway gates to improve
the learning quality of \RGCNs.

	

	
%	
%	To address these issues, several embedding-based methods have been proposed and achieve promising results. JE~\cite{hao2016joint} jointly learns the embeddings of different \KGs in a uniform vector space for entity alignment based on aligned entities. MTransE~\cite{chen2016multilingual} also uses structural information of \KGs for cross-lingual KG alignment with known aligned triples. Also for cross-lingual \KG alignment, JAPE~\cite{sun2017cross} proposed a joint attribute-preserving embedding model based on aligned entities, relations and attributes. Moreover, ITransE~\cite{zhu2017iterative} presented iterative entity alignment via joint knowledge embeddings, requiring all relations being shared among KGs.
%	
%	Since utilizing TransE to embed entities, JE, MTransE, JAPE and ITransE might not perform well under several tough situations and these embedding-based approaches all ignored the specific attribute values as mentioned in Section~\ref{section:intro}. In addition, the seed alignments required by MTransE, JAPE and ITransE are difficult to obtain in practice.
%	
%	Instead of utilizing TransE, our approach leverages R-GCNs~\cite{Schlichtkrull2017Modeling} to better characterize entities by incorporating the neighboring relational structure information and considers the specific value information in multiple KGs.
