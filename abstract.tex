		Entity alignment is the task of linking entities and their counterparts among multiple knowledge graphs (\KGs). 
		Most recent works rely on knowledge graph embedding methods, such as TransE, to represent entities and their context, which often have difficulties in identifying sparse but discriminative evidence, utilizing attribute values and dealing with unbalanced neighboring context. 
		To address these issues, we present RGCN, a novel entity alignment model which leverages relational graph convolutional networks to better characterize entities by incorporating the neighboring relational structure information and taking attribute values into account. 
		We further introduce layer-wise highway network gates to filter out the propagation of noisy information and ensure effective spread of more informative and discriminative neighborhood information. 
		Experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach further improves entity alignment performance on various \KGs, and gets the best performance compared with competitive baselines.
