	In this paper, we propose a novel neural framework for entity alignment over heterogeneous KGs, which leverages relational graph convolutional networks to better characterize entities when the available clues for alignment are sparse by considering the neighboring relational structures as well as attribute value information.
	We further utilize highway network gates to enable our model to control the amount of useful neighborhood information expansion. Experiments shows that our solutions can provide more accurate and discriminative entity representation in various situations for high-quality entity alignment. 
	
	In the future, we will take KG relations or predicates into consideration to explore richer
	semantics for both entity alignment and predicate alignment simultaneously.
