                       knowledge graphs. At the heart of our approach is a relational graph convolutional network that can leverage the
                       semantic and attribute embeddings of the input knowledge graphs. To control the inevitable noise when performing
                       learning on a large graph, we employ highway gates to control the amount of neighborhood information passing through
                       neural network layers. We evaluate our approach by applying it to two real-world datasets. Experimental results show
                       that our approach significantly outperforms the prior state-of-the arts by generating higher quality entity
                       alignment and providing more accurate and discriminative entity representation.
